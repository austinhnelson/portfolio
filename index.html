          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer who enjoys solving complex problems and
            continuously learning throughout that process. I have experience
            building full-stack applications, encompassing everything from
            DevOps to domain design, as well as developing desktop applications
            using the .NET Framework. I thrive in collaborative environments and
            embrace challenges as huge opportunities for growth. Outside of
            work, I enjoy lifting heavy weights, going on long runs, playing
            chess, as well as experimenting with unfamiliar technologies.
